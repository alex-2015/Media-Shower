Media Shower is the result of @theprojectabot and @kestralsoftware working together at the iPadDevCamp 2010 to create a little project that allows the user on the iPad to watch a series of videos in a video wall fashion on their iPad then click one to go full screen.

MPMoviePlayerController does not allow mutliple controllers to each be playing at the same time... so we just set up a NSTimer to grab frames from each of the controllers and present them in separate UIImage views...

Its a hack and its been slapped together but hopefully someone gets some use of it.
